Vehicles is a mod(pack) for [Minetest](https://github.com/minetest/minetest)
aiming at providing a feature-rich API for adding a variety of land vehicles
(basically everything that has wheels and moves on the ground, excluding trains) to the game. It will focus heavily on a realistic simulation of driving physics and modularity.

## Main features (planned)
- Accurate driving physics (no Arcade-style)
	- Torque-based engine simulation
	- Accurate simulation of longitudinal and lateral forces
	- Drive train simulation (Clutch, Gearbox, Differential)
	- Influence of aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance and engine brake
	- Weight simulation (influenced by chassis, components, passengers and load)
	- Wear simulation (sooner or later, your brakes need to be replaced...)
- Cars as useful objects
	- Transport of players (passenger seats)
	- Transport of items (trunk)
- Customization and tuning
	- replaceable components (engine, clutch, gearbox, differential, tires, brakes...)
	- tuning of components
- Alternative drive concepts (e.g. electric vehicles)
- Education (basic knowledge about how a car works, especially interesting for kids)

## Frequently asked questions
### When will this mod be published?
This will take quite some time. I'm in a dual study course of Business Informatics, so please be patient.

### Why another vehicles mod?
Touch√©. There are already some vehicle mods out there, including my [streetscars](https://github.com/webD97/streetscars). *streetscars* has been abandoned because it is very unflexible and badly implemented. Additionally it was created in the hope that it could be added to *StreetsMod* one day, which obviously never happened. *Vehicles* can be seen as its successor.

My goals and plans for this mod differ heavily from what can be found out there. The development of a (maybe even *the*) car mod has always been a dream for me.
